This is a job scheduling application built with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.
The Job Scheduling Application helps users manage their schedules efficiently. It provides features for accepting new jobs only if it fits in the schedule, as well as visualizing the schedule in a calendar format.

## About the Project
●	Developed and implemented a job scheduling portal leveraging location and time constraints, boosting daily job capacity by 25%, resulting in improved operational efficiency and increased customer satisfaction.

●	Developed a dynamic distance matrix for job locations, leveraging the Travelling Salesman Problem algorithm to calculate minimum traveling time, optimizing resource allocation and reducing travel costs by 20% on average.

●	Decided to accept or reject new job requests according to the specified working hour limit.

●	Utilized MERN Stack, OpenStreetMap API, Leaf-let Routing Machine and TSP algorithm to create a time-saving digital platform.
